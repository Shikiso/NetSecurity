## Password Cracking
### Brute Foce
Brute force attacks use the computers resources to test
the users password against every combination. These attacks can
take very long if the password is long and complicated.

### Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses a list of common passwords (many are
available online) to guess the users password. A common lists
is the RockYou.txt. However many companies also use these lists
to disallow certain passwords.

### Rainbow Table
A rainbow table is very similar to a dictionary attack
however is uses a precompiles list of passwords with their
plain text version along side them. This makes this attack
must faster than a dictionary since it doesn't need to waste
time hashing the password.

## DOS
A denail of service attack is commonly used to distrupt the flow
of data being sent and recieved or stopping this flow entirely.
A distrubuted denail of service or (DDOS) completes the same attack
but multiple machines (usually a botnet) attack the host or server.
This attack involves sending a large amount of packets to the server or host
to increase the time it takes to interact with clients or crashing the
server or host entirely so that it cannot be used.
