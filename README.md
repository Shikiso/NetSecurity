## Password Cracking
### Brute Foce
Brute force attacks use the computers resources to test
the users password against every combination. These attacks can
take very long if the password is long and complicated.

### Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses a list of common passwords (many are
available online) to guess the users password. A common lists
is the RockYou.txt. However many companies also use these lists
to disallow certain passwords.

### Rainbow Table
A rainbow table is very similar to a dictionary attack
however is uses a precompiles list of passwords with their
plain text version along side them. This makes this attack
must faster than a dictionary since it doesn't need to waste
time hashing the password.
